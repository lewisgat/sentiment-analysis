This is a project whereby we aim to look at the impact of social media popularity on the short to medium term returns of US stocks. The csv files are used to obtain the tickers of companies listed on the American Stock Exchange, The New York Stock Exchange and the NASDAQ. These can be obtained from their websites. The 'TickerRedditPuller.py' file is used to obtain the number of mentions and the relevant stock returns and volatlities between two periods.
